# Getting an app key

An app key is a unique key that Plain uses to know which workspace you
are setting up chat for. It is safe to put this key in the source code of your
public website.

Let's create a new app key:

<Steps>

### Go to app settings

Open your workspace settings by click on your workspace name, then **Settings** â†’ **Apps**.

### Create a new app

Click on "New App" enter a public and private name. If you are creating an App to set up chat, the public name should be something which can be shown to your customers e.g. "Chat". The private name should instead be something identifiable to you e.g. "Chat Marketing Website".

### Done!

You don't need to take note of the app key right now. You can come back to this page later on and copy it.

If you are wondering about what "Public keys" are on this page: we will cover
them later on in the logged-in users section.
