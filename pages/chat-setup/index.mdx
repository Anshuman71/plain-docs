# Setting up chat

This guide help you get set up using Plain's chat. Chat can be great for teams who want to talk to their teams directly and quickly. 

There are two ways to use chat with Plain: 

### Option 1: Using a simple script tag
This is great if you want to get going quickly and are not worried about customising the chat to fit your brand. 

This is the easiest option to use chat.


### Option 2: Using our React chat library
This is great if you want to have more control over how chat works on your site. For example by making chat look and feel exactly like your app or by embeding it as part of your own UI. 

This is the most powerful way to integrate chat and **what we recommend** if you are using React.
