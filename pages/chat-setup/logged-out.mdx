## Logged-out chat

This allows visitors of your website who are not logged-in to chat to you.

        Let's start by installing the npm package. In your app directory, run:

        ```shell
        npm install @team-plain/react-chat-ui
        ```

        This package exports:

        - A `Chat` component which renders the Plain chat.
        - A custom `usePlain` hook which exposes a function to log out and the number of unread messages for the customer.
        - The `PlainProvider` which provides context for the `Chat` component and the `usePlain` hook.

        To use the chat UI on your website, you need to wrap your app with `PlainProvider` and use the `Chat` component wherever you want to show the chat UI.

        Unlike when using chat via the script tag â€” which automatically adds a floating chat bubble to your website â€” the `Chat` component will fill its parent. This means you have full flexibility in terms of **where** and **how** you want to show the chat.

        A basic example would look like this:

        ```tsx /APP_KEY/
        import React from 'react';

        import { PlainProvider, Chat } from '@team-plain/react-chat-ui';

        function App() {
            return (
                <PlainProvider appKey="APP_KEY">
                    <h1>My App</h1>
                    <Chat/>
                </PlainProvider>
            );
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<App/>);
        ```

        Replace `APP_KEY` with your app key that you [created earlier](./app-key/), which should look something like `appKey_uk_01GG7XEXD24GQ20GWV7SYBS83X`.

        Finally, go to your workspace **Settings** â†’ **Chat** and click on "Enable chat".

        If you load your app now, you'll be able to chat using the `Chat`
        component and see customer messages show up under "Waiting for Help" in
        your workspace in the [Support App](https://app.plain.com).

        To support logged-in users on your website, continue to the [support for logged-in users](./logged-in) page.

        To integrate the chat script tag, click on your workspace name and go to **Settings** â†’ **Chat**. If you have not created an app key yet, you'll be prompted to do it now. For help on how to do so take a look at the previous [getting an app key](./app-key/) page.

        Copy the full code fragment on that page and paste it in the page(s) you want the chat UI to show up.

        ![Script tag](/images/chat-setup/chat-setup-7.png)

        If you need an example, this is a very minimal web page with Plain chat integrated. To use this, replace the text `APP_KEY` with the key you got in the [getting an app key](./app-key.md) section.

        ```html filename="index.html" /APP_KEY/
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
            <title>Your website</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>Website</h1>
        <script>
            window.$plain = window.$plain || [];
            typeof plain === 'undefined' && (plain = function () { $plain.push(arguments); });
            plain("init", {appKey: "APP_KEY"});
        </script>
        <script async src="https://customer-chat.cdn-plain.com/latest/customerChat.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```

        Finally, go back to your workspace **Settings** â†’ **Chat** and click "Enable chat".

        If you don't need to support logged-in users, this is all you need to do! Your users will now be able to chat to you, and they will show up in your workspace in the [Support App](https://app.plain.com) ðŸŽ‰

        If your website has logged-in users, you can add [support for logged-in users](./logged-in/) in the next section.
