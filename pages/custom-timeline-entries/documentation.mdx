# Creating a custom timeline entry

In this recipe we'll be creating a refund timeline entry as seen in the screenshot:

<ImageContainer>
  ![A custom timeline entry in a customer's
  timeline](/images/custom-timeline-entries/example-entry.png)
</ImageContainer>

## Getting started

Before we make any API calls we first need to decide what we want the custom timeline entry to look like. You can use the [custom timeline entry playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/custom-timeline-entry-playground/) to prototype an entry.

In this example we'll use the "Refund processed" template but the full list of components that you can use in the custom timeline entry are documented in [Plain UI Components](/ui-components).

We'll be using the `upsertCustomTimelineEntry` mutation which allows to create a new custom timeline entry or update one if it exists.
This mutation requires the following permissions:

- `timeline:create`
- `timeline:edit`

        #### Mutation

        The GraphQL mutation is the following:

        ```graphql
        mutation upsertCustomTimelineEntry($input: UpsertCustomTimelineEntryInput!) {
            upsertCustomTimelineEntry(input: $input) {
                result
                timelineEntry {
                    id
                    customerId
                    timestamp {
                        iso8601
                    }
                    entry {
                        ... on CustomEntry {
                            title
                            # There are many more fields you could select here
                            # we're keeping it simple for this example.
                        }
                    }
                    error {
                        message
                        type
                        code
                        fields {
                            field
                            message
                            type
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        #### Variables

        **This is important:** remember to replace `c_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with an existing customer's id.

        ```json5 {2}
        {
            input: {
                customerId: 'c_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
                title: 'Refund processed',
                components: [
                    {
                        componentText: {
                        text: 'Invoice **#1301** was refunded to customer',
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        componentSpacer: {
                        spacerSize: 'XS',
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        componentText: {
                        textSize: 'L',
                        textColor: 'SUCCESS',
                        text: '**+ $413.20**',
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        componentDivider: {
                        spacingSize: 'M',
                        },
                    },
                    {
                        componentLinkButton: {
                        url: 'https://stripe.com',
                        label: 'View in Stripe',
                        },
                    },
                ],
            },
        }

## Side effects of custom timeline entries

When upserting a custom timeline entry you can also optionally specify any side effects which allow you to control what happens after you create a new custom timeline entry.

This is to support different kinds of entries. For example when a significant error happens in your back-end, and you create a custom timeline entry, you might want to proactively reach out the customer. Alternatively if the customer just makes a change to their account you probably don't need to do anything.

#### `changeCustomerStatusToActive`

If set to `true`, the customer's state will change to `ACTIVE` which will move them the Waiting for Help queue. A notification will be sent (depending on notification settings) exactly as if a customer got in touch like normal via email or chat.

#### `sendCustomTimelineEntryCreatedNotification`

If set to `true`, a notification will be sent **to the user assigned to the customer**, if they have the corresponding setting enabled in their notification settings.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💁‍♂️">

It's perfectly valid to set both of these fields to `true` at the same time. If you do this, the customer's state will move to `ACTIVE` and a notification will be sent to the assigned user and/or every other user in the workspace.

</Callout>
