# Customer Cards Documentation

This page is intended for a technical audience that will be implementing a customer card API.
Check out the [customer cards](/customer-cards) page for an overview.

## Protocol overview

Customer cards are not proactively loaded, all of it is just-in-time and pulled when required.
This means that if your APIs are slow your users of the Support App will see a loading spinner while cards load.

1. When a user in Plain opens up a customer's page the cards are loaded.
2. Plain's backend figures out which cards can be returned from the cache and which cards need to be loaded. On first
   load of the customer this would be all cards.
3. Then it figures out how many requests it needs to make (see [request deduplication](#request-deduplication) for
   details).
4. Your APIs are then called with the customer's details, so you can look up the customer's data in your systems
   (see [request](#request) section for details).
5. Your APIs then return customer cards that consist of [Plain UI components](/ui-components)
   (see [response](#response) section for details).
6. The cards are cached based on either an explicit TTL value in the response or the default TTL in the card config.
7. Card are shown to the user in Plain.
8. Users can optionally reload the card at any time in which case only that one card will be requested from your API.

A **few limits** to be aware of:

- Your API must **respond within 4 seconds**, or it will time out. Please keep performance in mind when building your API.
- You can have a **maximum of 25 customer cards** configured.
- Card **keys must be unique** within a workspace. A key can only contain alphanumeric, hyphen, and underscore characters (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`).

## Creating a customer card

To create a customer card head to **Settings** → **Customer Card** and enter the following details:

- **Title:** this will be displayed as the title of the card so even if the card fails to load users know which card is
  errored.
- **Key:** the link between this config and your API. A key can only contain alphanumeric, hyphen, and underscore
  characters (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`)
- **Default time to live (seconds):** by default how long Plain should cache customer cards.
  Minimum is 15 seconds, maximum is 1 year in seconds (31536000 seconds).
- **URL:** the URL of your API endpoint that will be built to return customer cards. Must start with `https://`.
- **Headers (optional):** the headers Plain should pass along when making the request. While this is optional it is
  **highly recommend** to add authorization headers or other tokens that authenticate the request as your API will be
  returning customer data.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🍱">
To get you started quickly, we've created a few example customer cards that you can configure and see how they look in your application. All example cards are available in our open source repository:
[team-plain/example-customer-cards](https://github.com/team-plain/example-customer-cards)

Here is one you can try right now:

- Title: e.g. "Usage"
- Key: `usage`
- Default time to live: e.g. 120
- URL: https://example-customer-cards.plain.com/

</Callout>

## Request

Plain will make the following request to your backend:

- **Timeout**: the request must complete within **4 seconds**, or it will be terminated.
  See [retry strategy](#retry-strategy) for details on how timed out requests are retried.
- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** the URL you configured on Customer Card settings page.
- **Headers:**
  - All the headers you provided on Customer Card settings page. This should typically include authentication headers.
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `Accept`: `application/json`
  - `Plain-Workspace-Id`: the ID of the workspace the customer is in. This is useful for logging or request routing.
  - `User-Agent`: `Plain/1.0 (plain.com; help@plain.com)`
- **Body:**
  - `cardKeys`: an array of card keys being requested
  - `customer`: an object with the customer's core details
    - `email`: the email of the customer
    - `externalId` (optional): if the customer has an `externalId` then it will be sent, otherwise it is `null`.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "cardKeys": ["plan-details", "subscription-status"],
  "customer": {
    "email": "alex@grocery.co",
    "externalId": "your_user_id_795BFCD5-130F-4E72-BD46-14F717BE0830"
  }
}
```

### Request deduplication

If you configure multiple customer cards that have the same API details then Plain will batch them and make only one request.

The request deduplication logic for customer card configs is:

- The following config properties are ignored: Title, Card key, Default TTL
- API URL: leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed, the rest is treated case sensitively and as is
  - For example these URLs would be treated **as different**:
    - `https://api.example.com/cards`
    - `https://api.example.com/cards/`
    - `https://api.example.com/Cards`
- API Headers: order of headers in config does not matter
  - Name: leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed and treated case **in**sensitively
    - For example these header names be treated **the same**:
      - `Authorization`
      - `AUTHORIZATION`
      - `   authorization   `
  - Value: no processing done, treated as is (be careful with any extra whitespace characters)
    - For example these header values would be treated **as different**:
      - `Bearer my-token`
      - `bearer my-token`
      - `   bearer my-token   `

## Response

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

For each key requested a corresponding card **MUST** be returned in the response, otherwise an integration error will be returned for that card.

Any extra cards in the response will be ignored.

</Callout>

Your API must respond with a **200 status code** or the response body won't be process and will be treated as an error.

The response body must be a JSON object with:

- `cards`: an array of cards. Every `cardKey` requested should have a corresponding `key` returned. Any extra returned
  cards will be ignored.
  - `key`: the requested key
  - `timeToLiveSeconds` (optional, nullable): can either be omitted or `null`. If provided it will override the default time to live value. This allows you to control caching on a case-by-case basis.
  - `components` (nullable): `null` to indicate that the card has no data or an array of [Plain UI Components](/ui-components/).

Example response body for a card cached for 1 hour:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "key": "plan-details",
      "timeToLiveSeconds": 86400,
      "components": [
        {
          "componentRow": {
            "rowMainContent": [
              {
                "componentText": {
                  "text": "Plan",
                  "textColor": "MUTED",
                  "textSize": "M"
                }
              }
            ],
            "rowAsideContent": [
              {
                "componentBadge": {
                  "badgeLabel": "Starter",
                  "badgeColor": "YELLOW"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Example response body for a card that has no data and should not be displayed and TTL omitted:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "key": "plan-details",
      "components": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Retry strategy

Errors are classified into two categories:

1. Retriable errors: these are transient issues where retrying once is appropriate
2. Integration errors: these are typically programming or configuration errors. These errors won't be retried and cached for 5 minutes.

### Retriable errors

The following errors are **retried once** after a **1-second delay**:

- HTTP 5xx response status code
- HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code
- The request times out after 4 seconds.
- Plain fails to make the request for some reason

Retriable errors are not cached, therefore if the cards are requested again via the Support App they will be re-requested.

### Integration errors

The following errors are **not retried**:

- All HTTP 4xx response status codes except for HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response status code.
- A card key is missing in the response, for example if `subscription-details` is requested but the `cards` array in the response doesn't have an element with `subscription-details` key.
- The response body does not match the expected schema documented in [response](#response).

Integration errors are cached for 5 minutes and usually indicate a programming or configuration error.

Users have the ability to manually refresh a card in which case the card will be requested again.
