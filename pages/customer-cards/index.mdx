Customer cards

Customer cards are a powerful feature in Plain which let you show any information you want about a customer in Plain. This makes sure you always have important context when helping customers.

Customer cards are:

- **Pulled** from your backend so you do not have to sync your customer data to Plain.
- **Short lived** so that no data is permanently stored in Plain beyond the time frame you set.
- Defined using a simple **JSON** schema, so you don't have to worry about styling them.
- **Automatically reloaded** if a user is viewing a customer and the data expires.

## How does it work

At a high level this is how customer cards work:

1. A customer is viewed in Plain.
2. Plain fires a request to your back-end with:

   - The customer's email, `externalId`
   - The configured customer card `key`'s

3. Your back-end responds with the JSON for each card
4. Cards are shown to the user in Plain.

Plain will send a request like the example below to your API based on your customer card config:

```json
{
  "cardKeys": ["plan-details"],
  "customer": {
    "email": "alex@grocery.co",
    "externalId": "your_user_id_795BFCD5-130F-4E72-BD46-14F717BE0830"
  }
}
```

Your API should then reply with a list of cards matching the requested keys where each card contains the components you want to display:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "key": "plan-details",
      "timeToLiveSeconds": 86400,
      "components": [
        {
          "componentText": {
            "text": "Enterprise Tier"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## UI Components

You can use the Plain UI components to define how your customer data should be laid out and presented to the user.

All the components are documented in the [Plain UI Components](/ui-components/) section.

For example customer cards and an example API you can check out [team-plain/example-customer-cards](https://github.com/team-plain/example-customer-cards). Feel free to try these out in your workspace!

## Caching of cards

Caching of customer cards is controlled via two properties:

1. A default time to live value (in seconds) in the customer card's settings. This can be changed under **Settings** â†’ **Customer Cards**. Any changes will only apply to newly loaded customer cards.
2. An explicit time to live value (in seconds) in the Customer Card API response with the key `timeToLiveSeconds`. This allows your API to dynamically set the TTL using custom logic.

Any card that is past its expiry time will usually be deleted within a few minutes, but latest within 48 hours of it expiring.

## Playground

The [Customer Cards Playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/customer-cards-playground/) lets you build and preview the component JSON needed to create a customer card. Use this to prototype a customer card before starting to build your integration.

## Customer cards vs. custom timeline entries

Customer cards are used to add context to a customer's panel which is always visible. This is useful if the key information shown in customer cards is always relevant. If you want to show events that happened at a specific point in time, then using [Custom Timeline Entries](/custom-timeline-entries/) is more appropriate.

## Pricing

Loading and caching of Customer Cards for a customer will not count towards your usage of monthly active customers. We think having the full context for a customer should be a given, rather than premium.
