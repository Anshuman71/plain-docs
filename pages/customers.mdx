# Managing Customers

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’…" type="info">
  This is optional and not a required step to use Plain.
</Callout>

Customers that reach out to you will automatically be created in Plain without requiring any API integration.

However, using our API to manage customers proactively can be helpful when you are optimising your support workflow.

For example:

- You can [**put customers into groups**](/customers/customer-groups/) to allow you to better organize your support queue. For example, you could break your customers down into what tier they are in (e.g. Free Tier, Teams, Enterprise)
- You can [**create customers**](/customers/upsert-customers/) in Plain when they sign-up so that you can reach out to them proactively without waiting for them to get in touch.
- You can [**save your own customer's ID**](/customers/upsert-customers) on the Plain customer for use with [**Customer Cards**](/customer-cards/).

## Data model

Customers in Plain are very thin, with only a handful of fields by design. If you want to show more information on a customer, you should use [Customer Cards](/customer-cards/).

The key fields on a customer are:

- `fullName`: The customer's first and last name together (e.g. Jane Foo)
- `shortName`: The customer's first name (e.g. Jane)
- `email`
  - `email`: Their email address. Email addresses are unique to customers in Plain.
  - `isVerified`: A boolean indicating whether the customer's email is somehow verified (e.g. it's their login method in your product)
- `externalId`: The customer's ID in your systems. This is the field that lets you join customers in Plain with customers in your systems.
