# Schema

We build Plain using this API so there are no limits in terms of what you can do programmatically vs. using the Plain app.

If you need the schema programatically for codegen or if you just want to read the schema you can view the [**raw GraphQL schema**](https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1/schema.graphql).

You can also use the API explorer to learn about our API schema. This is the easiest way of discovering everything that is possible with the GraphQL API. To do this, go to the API Explorer and click on the documentation icon top left.
