# Schema

We build Plain using this API so there are no limits in terms of what you can do programmatically vs. using the Plain app.

To discover the complete list of queries and mutations available, you can either explore our [**raw schema**](https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1/schema.graphql) or use the API explorer.
