# Introduction to Plain

Plain is an the customer customer support tool for technical products.

We want to bring engineering and customer service teams together by creating a modern opinionated platform that's built to be built with.

### What does API-first mean?

Being is build API-first. This means

- That we will always use the same API to build Plain that you have access to. This means that you will never be
  given a simplified API or be restricted in what you can and can't do programmatically via Plain. This enables you to
  build powerful workflows.

- That we consider API users of new features on the same level as users of our Support App. This means that we will
  avoid building features which overly rely on logic in the UI layer and instead build APIs to access the logic.

### Where should I start?

First you should sign-up to plain. You can do so on https://app.plain.com/ and set up your workspace.

This means at the very least [setting up email](/TODO).

After that you can:
- [Build a contact form](/TODO) to pre-triage all of your customer requests
- [Setting up chat](/TODO) to talk to your customers more quickly
- [Log important events to your customer's timelines](/TODO) so that when they get in touch
- [Set up customer cards](/TODO) to get real-time information on your customer when you are helping them.
- [Make your first API call](/TODO)

If you have any feedback on our docs we'd love to hear it! Open an issue straight in [Github](/TODO) or drop us an email
at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com).
