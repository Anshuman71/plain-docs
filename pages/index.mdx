# Introduction to Plain

Plain is an the customer customer support tool for technical teams and products.

We want to bring engineering and customer service teams together by creating a modern opinionated platform that's fantastic to build with.

### Where should I start?

First you should sign-up to plain. You can do so on https://app.plain.com/ and set up your workspace.

This means at the very least [setting up email](/email-setup).

After that you can:

- [Log important events](/custom-timeline-entries) to your customers' timeline so you have the full context when helping.
- [Add customer cards](/customer-cards) to get information directly from your backend when helping customers.
- [Organize your customers into groups](/customers-setup/customer-groups) so you can better prioritise.
- [Expore our API](/graphql-api) to build automations custom to you.
