# Introduction to Plain

Plain is an the customer customer support tool for technical teams and products.

We want to bring engineering and customer service teams together by creating a modern opinionated platform that's fantastic to build with.

### Where should I start?

First you should sign-up to plain. You can do so on https://app.plain.com/ and set up your workspace.

This means at the very least [setting up email](/TODO).

After that you can:

- [Setting up chat](/chat) to talk to your customers more quickly
- [Log important events to your customer's timelines](/custom-timeline-entries) so that when they get in touch
- [Set up customer cards](/customer-cards) to get real-time information on your customer when you are helping them.
- [Make your first API call](/TODO)

If you have any feedback on our docs we'd love to hear it! Open an issue straight in [Github](/TODO) or drop us an email
